## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each folder has a clear purpose, making it easier to locate and maintain code.

2. **Scalability**: As your application grows, this structure scales well without becoming unwieldy.

3. **Reusability**: Components, hooks, and utils are organized to maximize reusability.

4. **Maintainability**: Keeping related code together makes maintenance easier.

5. **Collaboration**: Team members can understand the project organization quickly.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Components**: Break down UI elements into small, reusable components. Keep them generic in the `ui` folder and more specific in other component folders.

- **App Router**: Use the Next.js App Router structure with organized routes in the `app` directory. Group related routes using parentheses notation.

- **Hooks and Context**: Extract complex state logic into custom hooks and context providers.

- **Types**: Define shared TypeScript interfaces and types in the `types` directory.

- **Services**: Keep API service functions and external integrations in the `services` folder.

## Implementation

To create this structure, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Create base directories
mkdir -p src/app/(routes) src/app/api
mkdir -p src/components/ui src/components/forms src/components/layouts src/components/common
mkdir -p src/lib/utils src/lib/api
mkdir -p src/hooks src/context src/types src/services src/styles src/config src/data
```

Adjust as needed for your specific project requirements.
